# Current Business Status
A company in Australia currently have a web application running on-premisis in a Linux virtual machine. The application is being used by hundreds of customers every day and it is based on Wordpress which uses LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP) to offer great products.

Currently the solution is hosted in a single server (application and database) and deployments are made through FTP transfers to the server.

__Business Problem Statement__

The CEO is worried that a traffic peak may bring down the website whih is a great loss to the business as a whole.

## Business Requirement
The CEO wanted to migarte the On-premesis Web Application to AWS cloud and below are the requirements for the pilot migration project. 

*  Containeraize the application using Docker.
*  The application needs to be secure (all data encrypted at rest and in transit).
*  The application needs to be Highly Available.
* The application needs to support peaks of up to 10 times the average load (scalability).
* The infrastructure needs to be reproducible and version controlled in case the CEO decides to expand the business to other parts of the world (consider infra as code).
* There must be an easy and secure way of developing, with fast feedback (consider CI/CD practices or at least automation scripts).

__Project Timeline__

The pilot project is expected to be completed and reviewed by mid August 2020, and ready for demostration on **17th August 2020**

### Deliverables
* A solution diagram containing all the components of the solution and explaining the data flow.
    ![Solution Diagram](./images/da-project-group3.png)
* Automatic Deployemnt strategy.
* Strategy for Logging and Alarming the health of the system.
* Strategy for handling application component failure.
* List Improvements or Features not delivered in this phase

### Assumptions

1. Data Migration is out of scope as it is a pilot migration.
2. Consider to include the Unit/Integration/service test in the CI pipeline or automation scripts.
3. Single GitHib repo will be delivered.
4. This pilot migration will be delivered using Terraform code.

# Technology Solution - Getting Started

## Technology Products / Services
 After detailed brainstroming discussion and also considering the timelines of delivery, it is best to go with serverless in every layer of architecture possible. 
This way the infrastructrue resources are managed by AWS and gives good High Availability and Reliability to AWS resources. 

Below are the Technology Products chosen to deliver the Migration solution.

## Installation Steps

Installation of Wordpress Application requires the Infrastructure to be available to deploy the application. Terraform is used for the creation of Infrastructure and related Networks.  

Below are the different stages of Application Installation and readiness.
   1. Infrasture Readiness
   2. Application Installation
   3. Securing Application
   4. Logging and Alarming

### I. Infrastructure Readiness

A Well architected Infrastructure needs to have High Availability, Reliability. The AWS cloud is built in Sydney region, considering the users are specific to Australia. 
Also, the infrastructure is built across 3 availability zones (ap-southeast-2) to achieve High Availabiity in case of diaster.
